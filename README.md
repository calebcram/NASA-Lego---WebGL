# NASA-Lego---WebGL

The is a minigame built in Unity based on the Lego project template. I scanned various objects around NASA Johnson Space Center with LumaAI and used them to generate (NeRF's) Neural Radiance Fields which I was able to generate obj meshes from. I then decimated the meshes for optimization and loaded them into the Unity project, building a small WebGL minigame around it.
